By joining Kyokan, you commit to:

- respect, patience and empathy for every interaction/relation with coworkers and the community

## Be prepared to manage dichotomies

Success in your work will require working with and through tensions/dichotomies such as:
- Confidence taking projects from 0-60 *or* from 60-120
- Comfort in both management heavy orgs with heirarchies, *and* flat, manager-free teams
- Creativity and determination to engineer the best of both usability *and* security into the decentralized web experience
- Flying-solo *and* working in highly collaborative teams
- Tenacity and focus to achieve high dev velocity *and* engineering quality
- Bringing steadiness to chaos *and* energy+urgency to times of complacency

## Technical requirements

We are hiring for full-stack engineers who specialize in JavaScript. We will likely hire more than one, with at least one focused on the backend and at least one focused on the front end. We looking for candidates with multiple years of production experience.

Candidates looking to pursue a *front end focus* should be proficient with front end frameworks, but also with vanilla js. They should be confident with build tools (e.g. gulp, webpack), css tools (e.g. sass), and how browsers work.

Candidates looking to pursue a *back end focus* should be proficient with node.js in server side contexts. They should be confident architecting and implementing APIs, engineering with security and stability in mind, and generally strong with devops.

Candidates for both roles will stand out if they have experience that stretches beyond JavaScript application development. Could be one or more of: systems programming languages, devops, blockchain protocol implementations, smart contracts, machine learning, building CLI based developer tools, distributed systems, cryptography, security engineering, IoT

## Some logistical details

- Salary open to negotiation, equity a possibility
- We are open to, and may request, starting successful candidates off with a period of part time work focused on a single project, to get to know one another and decide if we are a great match.

Boson Protocol is advancing the world of commerce by enabling enterprises, organisations, and customers to bridge the divide between digital decentralized technologies and the 
transfer and trade of physical goods. 

Our vision is for Boson to become the basic plumbing for dCommerce and its data on the emerging decentralized web, where the value captured is distributed equitably between 
token holders and protected from capture by a single centralized entity. Read more about us here: https://bosonprotocol.io/

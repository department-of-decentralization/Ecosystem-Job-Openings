# **Rust / C++ Backend Engineer**

€50 – 140k + Equity / Tokens

*Berlin based or willing to relocate*

Chainflip enables cross-chain cryptocurrency swapping - like swapping Bitcoin for Ethereum - without using centralised exchanges, 
specialised wallets, or wrapped tokens. Think of it like Uniswap, but you will always receive the native token.

Existing decentralised token swapping solutions suffer from a range of issues that severely limit usability, privacy, and practicality.
Utilising a highly secure system of Vault Nodes, Chainflip is a protocol for automated cross-chain token swaps that resolves these 
issues with a truly decentralised solution.

We will be dramatically expanding the team over the next 6 months, and we’re looking for people who are looking to be a part of a 
fast growing early stage team to carry forward the vision we have for the future of permissionless value transfer. 

You’ll be joining an experienced founder along with an existing engineering team and ongoing support from another major project. 
We’re an early stage venture but we already have momentum, funding and, most importantly, a plan.

If you’re ambitious, experienced, and passionate about DeFi we want to hear from you.

## **The Role**

As an early member of the Chainflip team you will have the opportunity to grow within the business and propel your career in an 
industry that can truly change how we view self-sovereignty and transfer of value. 

Much of our backend technology stack relies heavily on our own Rust based software which includes p2p networking, consensus mechanisms, 
blockchain technology, and cryptography.

For this role, you will have a professional history as a software engineer, ideally within the cryptocurrency industry, and will be at 
least familiar with rust and/or C++. You will have been developing software professionally for at least 3 years. 

Although a challenging task, our existing engineering team of four are capable of delivering the product, but with additional 
experienced engineers working alongside them, we will be able to achieve much more in a shorter time frame. As an early joiner to 
Chainflip you have an amazing opportunity to help steer the direction of our toolset and software, and also the scope of what we are building.

Additionally, there is the opportunity for the right candidate to become the CTO or similar if the candidate has extensive software 
development managerial experience.

Salary range is €50k - 140k, plus equity/tokens

## The Process

Please submit your CV for review. For our engineering or technical roles, the first stage is a 1hr remote code interview run by our existing 
engineering team in a language of your choice. Following this you will have a more informal meeting with some other members of the team.

This is a key hire, so we are willing to move quickly for the right person.

If you have any questions about the role, or would like to submit your information directly, you can email [team@chainflip.io](team@chainflip.io)

We look forward to hearing from you and hope that you join us on our journey.

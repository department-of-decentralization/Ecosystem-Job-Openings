# Who are we? #
Energy Web Foundation (EWF) is a non-profit founded with a vision of accelerating the transition to a decentralized, democratized, decarbonized, and resilient energy system. Vision statements can be a mouthful, but we truly believe that the energy sector needs to undergo a dramatic change. We want to see us moving away from burning fossil fuels and moving towards renewables. We believe the way to accelerate change is through knowledge sharing and what better way to do it than through open source.

# What will you do? # 
You’ll work on Origin, an open-source decentralized application for renewable energy and carbon markets. Origin development has two tracks. The first one is open source development and its reference implementation. The second track is helping our affiliates create real-world product starting from customizing Origin and adding features to match their needs, deploying and testing smart contracts with real-world assets, and finally funneling back knowledge and features into Origin’s open source codebase. Your work will focus on the second track. 

Part of your work will also include the development of showcases for us to demo on conferences and meetups, in order for us to show capabilities of our technology and motivate people to think outside the box and see new possibilities.

# What are your responsibilities? # 
* Working closely with our affiliates ranging from small startups to the biggest companies in the energy sector in order to help accelerate and adopt Origin in the real world
* Extending and customizing existing Origin’s codebase to fit real-world needs
* Deploying Origin’s smart contracts to testnet (Tobalaba)
* Creating bridges between datasets owned by affiliates and Tobalaba
* Creating showcase demos for hackathons and conferences
* Helping organizing hackathons, conferences, meetups both as a developer and a speaker (won’t be forced to speak if you're terrified of public speaking)

# What’s required to apply? # 
* 1-3 years of experience in Javascript (including university projects) both in frontend web development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, ...) and backend (Node.js, ...)
* Focus on objected oriented paradigms and principles
* Basic knowledge of Typescript

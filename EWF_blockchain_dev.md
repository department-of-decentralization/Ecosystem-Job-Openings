# What are we looking for? #
Full-time blockchain developer based in Berlin. 

# Who are we? #
Energy Web Foundation (EWF) is a non-profit founded with a vision of accelerating the transition to a decentralized, democratized, decarbonized, and resilient energy system. Vision statements can be a mouthful, but we truly believe that the energy sector needs to undergo a dramatic change. We want to see us moving away from burning fossil fuels and moving towards renewables. We believe the way to accelerate change is through knowledge sharing and what better way to do it than through open source.

# What will you do? #
You’ll work on Origin, an open-source decentralized application for renewable energy and carbon markets. More specifically you’ll work on expanding initially Origin’s vision to new use cases, mainly focusing on electric vehicles (EV) space. 

With a rising number of EVs, there’s a growing need to address questions like what’s the carbon footprint of each EV, can we automated and smooth out EVs impact on the local grid, and can we create a seamless integration and data sharing between EVs, charging stations, and energy producers? In order to support the industry in addressing the questions, EWF started extending Origin’s code-base to cover the aforementioned EV use cases. Your work will include the development of an open-source toolkit to its real-world production readiness. 

Part of your work will also include the development of showcases for us to demo on conferences and meetups, in order for us to show capabilities of our technology and motivate people to think outside the box and see new possibilities.

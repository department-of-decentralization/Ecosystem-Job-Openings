## [Clearmatics](https://www.clearmatics.com/careers) is hiring! 


### What we're building

At [Clearmatics](https://www.clearmatics.com), we are designing, building and deploying peer-to-peer platforms for financial industry participants to transact seamlessly and securely without unnecessary intermediaries.

We call our technology approach "decentralized automation", which combines cryptography, consensus protocols and economic mechanism design.

Our mission is to build peer-to-peer infrastructure resistant to the monopoly-making tendencies of network effects inherent in today's client-server architectures.

Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community. We also work closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and are an active member of the Ethereum Entreprise Alliance (EEA).
